Password Cracking Report – Booking System Phase 2

We extracted the MD5 password hashes from the Booking System database and attempted to crack them using common dictionary-based cracking methods. Since MD5 is weak and unsalted, the passwords were cracked immediately using publicly available cracking tools.

Cracked Passwords

1. Hash:

a0e8402fe185455606a2ae870dcbc4cd


Password: whatsup
Explanation: This hash matched a known dictionary word. It appears in common wordlists.

2. Hash:

d730fc82effd704296b5bbcff45f323e


Password: doh123
Explanation: A simple weak password combining a name with digits.

3. Hash:

735f7f5e652d7697723893e1a5c04d90


Password: darkknight
Explanation: MD5 of a common pop-culture word. Easily found in dictionary lists.

4. Hash:

7cb56c2b86150b797cff32eaef97f338


Password: chimichanga
Explanation: Also appears in dictionary lists and common password dumps.

Required Questions
1. Difference between dictionary and non-dictionary attacks:

Dictionary attack: tries known words from a wordlist (fast and effective for weak passwords).

Non-dictionary attack (bruteforce): tries every possible combination (much slower but can crack anything if given time).

2. Advantage attacker gains from seeing the database:

The attacker gets:

All usernames

All MD5 password hashes

Ability to crack weak hashes offline
This bypasses login rate limits and lockout protections.

3. Why longer passwords are more secure:

Longer passwords exponentially increase the number of possible combinations, making brute-force attacks extremely slow or impossible within realistic time.
